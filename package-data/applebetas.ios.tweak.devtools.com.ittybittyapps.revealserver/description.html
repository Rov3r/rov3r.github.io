<p>Install RevealServer to inspect any application's view hierarchy with <a href="https://revealapp.com">Reveal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use at your own risk:</strong></p>
<p>This will inject the tool into every app, including SpringBoard, even if you haven't activated it yet. Because of this, you should not use it on unsecured Wi-Fi networks, as it will expose every app's view hierarchy to any potential malicious actors on the same network running Reveal. It may also cause other issues with some applications and services.</p>

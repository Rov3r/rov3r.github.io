<p><strong>CAUTION: This is a developer tool, and has the capacity to make things act unexpectedly.</strong></p>
<p>Enable Apple's private UIDebuggingInformationOverlay in all apps (including SpringBoard). Toggle it with a two-fingered tap on the status bar.</p>
<p>This doesn't work with some really old apps (Cydia, CrashReporter), as the classes required are not supported on these versions.</p>

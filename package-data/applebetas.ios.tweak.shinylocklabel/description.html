<p>iOS 7-9 all had a cool animation of a gradient going from left-to-right on the lock screen, providing a subtle hint on how to unlock your phone. Now that slide to unlock is a thing of the past, so is that animation.</p>
<p>While it may not have the same use anymore, that animation was nonetheless a cool part of the lock screen. With ShinyLockLabel, you can have that effect once again.</p></li>

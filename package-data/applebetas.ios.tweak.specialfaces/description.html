<p><strong>Compatible with iOS 10</strong>
<p>Enable the special watch faces on any Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In watchOS, there are three sets of watchfaces that are included but only shown if you have a certain watch model. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nike+ Digital</li>
    <li>Nike+ Analog</li>
    <li>Herm&egrave;s faces</li>
</ul>
<p>With this tweak installed, they will show up in the watch app and be able to be added from the Gallery tab.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2 role="header">Important</h2>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Your special (not meant for your model, such as Nike+ or Herm&egrave;s) watchfaces may disappear at any time and need to be re-added from the Watch app on iOS. I will not provide support if this happens, as this verification is done on the watch side and there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
</li>
</li></ul>
<h2 role="header">Known issues</h2>
<ul><li>
    <ul>
        <li>Special watchfaces may disappear if Apple Watch is rebooted</li>
	<li>The Herm&egrave;s watchface appears with squares rather than numbers</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<p><strong>About this fork:</strong></p>
<p>This code has been modified by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/AppleBetasDev">@AppleBetasDev</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/nullriver">@nullriver</a> to add support for iOS 10. Full credit for everything else goes to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/evilgoldfish01">@evilgoldfish01</a>. In addition, this is an early build (hence the "beta"), so it will likely contain a lot of bugs. Feel free to report any to us, as long as they aren't in the list below.</p><br>
